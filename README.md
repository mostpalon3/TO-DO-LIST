# [TODO LIST](https://mostpalon3.github.io/TO-DO-LIST/)

The TODO LIST is a simple and small JavaScript project that allows users to manage tasks and dates effectively. Users can input tasks along with their due dates, and the application saves this information in the browser's local storage, ensuring that tasks persist across sessions. This project showcases practical use of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a functional and user-friendly task management tool.
